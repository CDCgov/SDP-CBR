# SDP-CBR

This example demonstrates how to configure Camel routes in Spring Boot via a Spring XML configuration file.

The application utilizes the Spring [`@ImportResource`](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportResource.html) annotation to load a Camel Context definition via a [camel-context.xml](src/main/resources/spring/camel-context.xml) file on the classpath.

### Building

The application can be built with the following command

    mvn clean package
	
### Databases

The application depends on a number of databases and connections in order to run.  All databases are defined in the application properties, which should be configured for the environment.  

Required databases for deployment are the phinMsDataSource and sdpqDataSource.  The phinMsDataSource should have the table message_inq, which can be created in SQLServer using the script at main/db/MSSQL_message_inq.sql.  The other tables will be created as needed by the application.
	
### Testing

The application unit tests can be run with the following command

	mvn test
	
In order for the tests to succeed, the test datasources must be properly configured.  All test datasources are specified in the test properties file at src/test/resources/application.properties.  If any of the datasources are not configured, the tests will fail.

Required databases for tests are nndssDataSource, sdpqDataSource, and phinMsDataSource.  The phinMsDataSource should have the table message_inq, which can be created in SQLServer using the script at main/db/MSSQL_message_inq.sql.  The other tables will be created as needed by the application.

### Running the application in OpenShift

It is assumed that:
- OpenShift platform is already running, if not you can find details how to [Install OpenShift at your site](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/install_config/index.html).
- Your system is configured for Fabric8 Maven Workflow, if not you can find a [Get Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-middleware-for-openshift/3/single/red-hat-jboss-fuse-integration-services-20-for-openshift/)

The application can be built and run on OpenShift using a single goal:

    mvn fabric8:deploy

To list all the running pods:

    oc get pods

Then find the name of the pod that runs this quickstart, and output the logs from the running pods with:

    oc logs <name of pod>

You can also use the OpenShift [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/getting_started/developers_console.html#developers-console-video) to manage the running pods, and view logs and much more.

### Running via an S2I Application Template

Application templates allow you deploy applications to OpenShift by filling out a form in the OpenShift console that allows you to adjust deployment parameters.  This template uses an S2I source build so that it handle building and deploying the application for you.

First, import the Fuse image streams:

    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/application-templates/GA/fis-image-streams.json

Then create the quickstart template:

    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/application-templates/GA/quickstarts/spring-boot-camel-xml-template.json

Now when you use "Add to Project" button in the OpenShift console, you should see a template for this quickstart.


### Running the application locally

The maven command to build the application described above produces an all-in-one jar file that can be run locally.  The jar file is created in the target directory and can be run with the following comand.

     java -jar target/sdp-cbr-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

When running locally the application can be configured through extenal properties files according as provided by the spring boot framework.  Information on this external configuration can be found at the following location. https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-profile-specific-properties

The base properties for the application are contained in the src/main/resources/application.properties file.  This file is basically a template for fields that will need to be filled out in order for the routes to run.  Please review the file in order to understand the configuration parameters that are required.

# Filtering on HL7 message contents

The HL7Terser is designed to allow for complex filter parameters to be defined via the routes in the [camel-context.xml](src/main/resources/spring/camel-context.xml) file.  For more information on filter syntax, please review the syntax instruction in [Definitions.txt](Filter Definitions.txt).
